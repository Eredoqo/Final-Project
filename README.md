DAY 1:

    After the meeting in Teams with our coaches where the final project was presented, i was looking the docs where we can start and started to think for My Project Plan. The ideas were to many but some of them were out of scope for our Project, so i decided to create first my point of the view of the main focus creating the logic for having the result i want. Required Project was an app where we must do the survey for some question that will be created from diferent users from diferent boards, so i decided to start my requirements for starting it. 
		Requirements are:
	Starting backend part.
	Creating database tables.
	Creating frontend part.
	Creating and testing code with unit testing.
	Collaborating with my team.
	Using diferent tech logic for reaching the result.
	
	After that was the moment with team to show our ideas that we had for procceding with "Milestone". Almost all of our ideas in the team was the same and we had a good understamble of each other in group that eacch of us was reapecting the idea of the college and deciding in with idea we will go on.

	Me and the team agreed to start the Idea with the database so we could have the data to procced. Creating tables in Hasura it was quite easy for me cause from the last weeks where we learned Hasura and everything was in the right result of creating data. At this point i didn't had any errors and later on i started to study all the relationships of the database so i could had i better understaning of the data and that all for first day.

DAY 2:

	In day 2 in discuss with my team we have created the seeds data in database day 1. This day would bring me th first error to deal with, our types of the variables we created with the team was not in the proper way to respond what we requested for. The large amount of data that i tried to create didn't correspond with the variables created earlier. Searching in google was my best shot to solve the problem, youtube videos was really helpful cause it show the solving problem with video and i compare it with my problem and managing to solve it. After dealing this errors creating seeds or dummy data was with success.
		
	Creating relationships between tables again faced me some small errors some words written mistakly and placed in wrong order. This error i faced askingv my team our mentors in office and normaly google and youtube. Creating seeds and relationships was great and succes work from me.

DAY 3

	Day 3 was really difficult for me because i couldn't create actions and events in hasura. After seeding data me and my team started to work with actions and events. Almost half of my day was watching videos in youtube about hasura actions and events and studing many reapositories in github which were created with hasura and react. The first steps of creating hasura actions was kinda good cause the bvideos i saw earlier helped me to create it but later the errors just started. 
	Error "status: 500" but my teamleader handle it with some searches in stackoverflow.
	"Uexpected response" the worst error we faced cause the endpoint wasn't the right one and studied marcos code and other repos in github to find the right configuration. 
	“webhook handler" another error that me and team faced was a good point to understand the connection with our frontend code. We tried some lines of code in frontend to try the connection with hasura action. 
	Actions in Graphql Hasura database is our main focus in this days. After all errors we didn't had the result we want but we learned some valuable lessons how to work in team and how to google our errors.

DAY 4
	
	My Fourth day started with an energy to work and started to code to work with those data i created in the tables. After the sessions i had with our SRUM and with my team i though with could start to do the hasura actions required and suggested in project plan presented. My teamleader ask for any ideas to other teams leaders in an opening discuss so we could work all together in which we were asked for in the project. 
	Creating actions wasn't easy because it was my first time to work with. Teamleader presented the way we should work and continue with our project. After some tried i had facing error was a normaly thing because the queries wasn't the right to run and create the mutations. I faced the error where creating post method created didn't correspond with our endpoint. Connecting the frontend part and some lines of code and adding the hasura queries didn't respond to my runnable code. Changing frontend code to connect with webhook made the error very dificult for me. Asking advices from my colleges but they were having the same issues like me and we all couldnt find the right way. 
	Youtube videos how to connect hasura with react query helped me a lot understanding th righ way to have the result but it was not enough. I asked help to Endrit our mentor and he gave me some tips i could create the idea and find the right way. In the end me and my team managed to create the queries form fetching data. The advices from our mentors, youtube videos, hasura docs, react query docs and other pages in google was really helpful to find dsome choises for the errors. Working in team was really helpful cause some ideas are better than one.

DAY 5

	Day five will start for me with a great desire to finish the week in the best way i could. After discussing with my team and other colleges for how to plan the day, i decided to study and work for the UI code. React MUI, react button radio, github repos, ect, were some of my studies for creating the idea of the frontend part. It was the idea to create maybe four or five types of answers with a different way of answering like images, dropdown, radio buttons, rating with stars and other ways i found in others repo and mui docs. 
	In team we saw what we had created till now, having a look some small changes that Marco had and having more careful with the Tests. After checks we made some changes in our database and started to create endpoints to call the questions in frontend part where we could have the answers. Fixing the seeds table was a little hard cause we faced errors like writing some code for mistake. In the end our UI idea was created till one point and we discuss with colleges to meet up during weekend and work for advancing in the project.

DAY 6

	This day was quite intense for me and my team cause we have worked and thought about our final week. In those 3 days off me and my team have neet up each other and discussing about errors and thinking the resolution. After discussing with team we thought we could start with a review of the code and database part like foreign key, ecc. Today me and team worked about creating the realtion between database and frontend, so in the end of the day we could have a result after the avdices we took during our weekend. It wasnt easy for  one of us we faced errors like network errors with hasura endpoint, installing axios like a library was an idea so we could call and insert data in database. In mutation we had kinda some errors like wrong path, wrong attributes and variables, wrong implement in frontend but this was managed in the end and had the result. Me in most of the time were to run and find the mutation to collect our answers and i was little creative in connection the database and frontend. In the end after all the time with error "network error" finaly found the connection and already tried in localhost and gitpod,  by changing the hasura engine to save the answers.

DAY 7

	Day by day our progress is growing, forexample today it was a nice day and productive. After daily meeting me and my team though what to work today and make some progress. In this day i started to work with UI part and working in time with my team to take result. Main focus was to make the token login to redirect the results connected with user id and survey id. It was an idea that we worked in team to find the solutin and we managed to bring the token in code and decode it  but me and my team wasnt able to connect to user id. With some help from our college Enea and result the code gave a result and the token is connected to user id. In login page in our code me and my team created the code only to login with token invited. Fixing the UI part like welcome page and css part in question page was a great code i achieved to do. During our last our we started to create the final page where we would show the score completed in questions and the notice that the survey in completed succesfully but we didnt finished the idea. It will be our main focus for tomorrow and it will be a great day cause we will present our idea for creating the app.
